Zone file 

Authoritative Domain Server (SOA)
At least one Zone File
Contains all FQDN to IP mappings for a domain

SOA can query other SOAs if it can't find a record
SOAs will then iteratively query Higher level SOA's

Once it finds a root server ( . ), root server refers to name server for .com, .net, .org subdomains
