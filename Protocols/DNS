Logical Group by Name 

Domain Name System
    - System used for naming computers and network services
    - Uses a hierarchal structure for organizing those objects into domains
	-> Root domain (.com, .net, .gov)
	-> Proposal (.com.mars., .net.mars.) when we expand to mars
    - Allows local control over domain name database segments
    - Data from all database segments is available everywhere
	-> This is because it is "Distributed"
    - Database information is robust and highly available 


Hierarchy
	Root (.com)
		Subdomain (google.com)
			Sub-subdomain (mail.google.com)

Resource Records
Most commonly used types

- A (address)
- CNAME (canonical name)
- Host information (HINFO)
- Mail Exchange (MX)
- NS name server

DNS
	- Primary master name DNS server (authoritative name server)
		- Where the primary DNS database files for the domains or subdomain reside
        - Primary master
		- Distinguished from other name servers for a domain
	- For any DNS zone
		- ONE primary master name server

Iterative Query
	- Go to foobar.baz
	- Unknown on first DNS server
	- A computer can try other DNS servers that it knows, in order to check them if they know "whodat?" 


START OF AUTHORITY RECORD

- Identifies the current name server as the best source of information for data in its zone
- Both secondary and primary name server
	- Can designate themselves as authoritative in their own SOA records. 

Reverse Address Lookups
	- IP to DN, instead of DN to IP
