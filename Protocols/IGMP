IGMP


- Completely new protocol, apart from ICMP

- Part of IP multicast

- One to many applications such as gaming, streaming video

- Separate transport layer protocol

    * Examples are sending an email to a mailing list
    * Teleconferencing or videoconferencing
    

- Recievers (designated multicast group) are interested in recieving. 

- Hosts that are interested must join group using IGMP

- Class D used for Multicast Group Addresses
	- 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255


- Class D is mapped directly to a MAC address. Using this method, NICs can recieve packets destined to many MAC addresses -- their own unicast, broadcast, and a range of multicast addresses
