Broadcast 

	- IPv4
	- Sent to Broadcast address X.X.X.255 (Class C)
	- Goes all the way up to the Transport layer (blocks on port level)

Multicast

	- Goes to Network layer, then stops when it finds a packet that is not bound to one of its MAC addresses
	- Uses less data processing because it stops at Data Link layer
