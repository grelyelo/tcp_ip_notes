Main outline for TCP/IP study

Categorical

# Routing
-- IP Stack
  -> Addresses, differences between IPv4 and IPv6. 
  -> How do IP rangees work

# Layers
  -- Hardware Layer
    -> On what layers does each protocol operate?
    -> How do the layers interoperate, how does each layer work with the others?
    -> How does Hardware layer work with the Layer 
  -- Data Link Layer
    -> What is Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection work?
    -> What is it really?
    -> What are Minimum Transmission Units (MTUs) and how do they work with how long a wire is?

# Protocols

 -- What are the Protocols and What do they Do?

   -> What protocols correspond to what layers

   -> UDP, TCP, IGMP, ICMP, DHCP

   -> Also, what belongs to Application and what belongs to Transport/Network/Link 
    
# Binary Briefing
  --Binary Numbers
    -> String of Binary numbers is something like (10010010)
 
  --Bitwise
    -> How to do bitwise calculation?
    -> Truth tables
    
  --Masking
    -> How to mask in binary
    -> convert to hex or decimal
